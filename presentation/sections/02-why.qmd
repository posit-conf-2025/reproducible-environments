# Why This Matters

_Reproducibility as the foundation for trust in Pharma_

## Reproducibility = Trust

- Required by **FDA, EMA, PMDA, GxP**  
- Repeatable results ⇒ credibility & compliance  
- Without it ⇒ **risk, rework, delays**

::: notes
Reproducibility is foundational for audits and long-term credibility.

## Pharma’s Legacy Struggles

- Monoliths, **manual validation**  
- “Validation tax”: **bloated, slow pipelines**  
- Two environments: **exploratory vs validated**

::: notes
Duplicated effort and inconsistencies when re-running work for submissions.
:::

## Containers Change Everything

- **Frozen, versioned execution** environments  
- Consistency across **dev → validation → submission**  
- Isolate deps (R, Python, SAS); **runs the same everywhere**  

They **enable all of this**, but can feel like a **mystery** — so we’ll **show them in action today**


## Beyond Containers

Containers are the backbone, but not the whole story, there's a whole ecosystem around them:

- **Managed package repos** ⇒ governance & trust  
- **Snapshot versions** ⇒ no surprises in re-runs  
- **Audited jobs** ⇒ capture runtime metadata  
- **Infrastructure as Code** ⇒ environments are reproducible end-to-end

::: notes
While we can't touch everything today, we'll touch on some of those points today

## Rafa’s & Appsilon's Perspective

Reproducibility is not only a **regulatory requirement**
it’s the foundation that lets science move **fast and responsibly**.  

- Reproducibility = **compliance × innovation**  
- Containers = **scalability + sustainability**  
- **One backbone**: validated & exploratory zones  
- **Modular, cloud-native** Scientific Environments

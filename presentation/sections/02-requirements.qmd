## You've got to roll with it!

A summary of experiences at Novartis.

Orla Doyle

## Adopting new tools 

- At Novartis we were testing the {rbmi} package for multiple imputation
- We weren't able to reproduce our results 
- The underlying algorithm is deterministic so this was unexpected
- The magnitude of the difference was enough to change the scientific conclusions



## Reproducibility Detective Work

**Did we set the seed?** *Yes!*  
**Is this related to hardware?** *No!*   
**Is this a problem with a specific OS linear algebra library?** *No!*  


## Open-source in action

Unlike closed-source solutions, we can examine the source code and collaborate in a transparent manner between developers and maintainers.

## Deployment at Novartis

```{mermaid}
timeline
    title Frozen R environments with ~6 month refresh
    H123 : R4.1.0 bundle 1
    H223 : R4.1.0 bundle 2
    H124 : R4.3.1 bundle 1
    H224 : R4.3.1 bundle 2
         : Project-level bundle using an adhoc, GxP install

```

- Current package management is a hybrid approach: frozen-model with the option to perform a rolling update at the study-level
- The rolling update is essential so we can use the latest, corrected version of packages
- Implementation of rolling update could be improved using managed tools like ppm

## Conclusions

- The packages we rely on are in a constant state of flux: this is a feature not a bug! 
- Our approach to package management needs to be fit-for-purpose and enabling timley access to the latest versions

## Adopting new tools 

- At Novartis we were testing the {rbmi} package for multiple imputation
- We weren't able to reproduce our results 
- The underlying algorithm is deterministic so this shouldn't be the case
- The magnitude of the difference was enough to change the scientific conclusions

## Reproducibility Detective Work

**Did we set the seed?** *Yes!*  
**Is this related to hardware?** *No!*   
**Is this a problem with a specific OS linear algebra library?** *No!*  
**Injected custom code into {rbmi} enabled us to localise the issue:** *Problem originates from {rbmi} dependencies.*
